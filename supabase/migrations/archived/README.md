# Archived Legacy Push Provider Migrations

These files were previously present as legacy push provider migration files and have been removed from the active migrations to avoid confusion.
They were replaced by the `push_players` migration which is the canonical migration for push tokens.

If you still need an historical copy from an earlier commit, use your VCS to retrieve previous migration content. They were intentionally removed to avoid accidental re-creation of deprecated artifacts.

Overview
----------------------------
The Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM) is a hardware-assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor) that uses Intel(R) Virtualization Technology (VT) to speed up Android* development.

This software:
- Uses Intel VT, available on selected Intel processors
- Provides hardware-accelerated emulation of Intel(R) x86 and x86_64 Android virtual devices
- Integrates with the Android SDK

----------------------------
Prerequisites
----------------------------
Intel(R) HAXM requires the Android SDK to be installed (version 17 or higher).
For best performance, using SDK version 20 or higher is recommended.

Please refer to the Android developer website (http://developer.android.com/sdk/) for more information.

System Requirements
----------------------------
Hardware Requirements:
- Intel(R) processor with support for VT-x, EM64T, and Execute Disable Bit

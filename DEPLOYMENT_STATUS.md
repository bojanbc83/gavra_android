## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION BUILD EXECUTING SUCCESSFULLY

### 📱 **Active Build Process**

- ✅ **FIXED**: Deprecated gradle property `android.enableBuildCache` removed
- 🟡 **IN PROGRESS**: `flutter build apk --release` with ProGuard optimization
- 🟡 **BUILDING**: Gradle assembleRelease executing with R8 full mode
- ⏱️ **STATUS**: Java compilation completed, Gradle optimization in progress

---

## 📋 FINAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1️⃣ **Complete Current Build** ⏳

- [ ] Wait for current `flutter build apk --release` to complete
- [ ] Verify APK generated in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`
- [ ] Check ProGuard optimization applied successfully

### 2️⃣ **Generate Production Keystore** 🔐

- [ ] Run: `.\generate_keystore.ps1` to create secure keystore
- [ ] Update `gradle.properties` with keystore credentials:
  ```properties
  KEYSTORE_FILE=gavra-release-key-new.keystore
  KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  KEY_ALIAS=gavra-release-key
  KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
  ```
- [ ] Configure signing in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
  ```kotlin
  signingConfigs {
      release {
          keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
          keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
          storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
          storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
      }
  }
  ```

### 3️⃣ **Build Signed Production APK/AAB** 📦

- [ ] Run: `flutter build apk --release` (with keystore configured)
- [ ] Run: `flutter build appbundle --release` for Google Play Store
- [ ] Execute: `.\build_production.ps1` for complete build validation

### 4️⃣ **Final Testing & Validation** 🧪

- [ ] Install release APK on test device
- [ ] Verify all screens function without memory leaks
- [ ] Test database performance improvements
- [ ] Confirm security hardening (AdminSecurityService)
- [ ] Run System Integration Tests on production build

### 5️⃣ **Google Play Store Upload** 🏪

- [ ] Upload signed AAB to Google Play Console
- [ ] Configure store listing with screenshots
- [ ] Set up staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- [ ] Enable crash reporting and performance monitoring

# 🚀 GAVRA ANDROID v6.0.0 - PRODUCTION LAUNCH CHECKLIST

# Final steps for Google Play Store deployment

## ✅ PRODUCTION BUILD STATUS: IN PROGRESS

**Current Status**: Flutter build apk --release executing with ProGuard/R8 optimizations

---

## 📱 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (After Build Completes)

### 1️⃣ **Verify Build Success**

- [ ] Confirm APK generated in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`
- [ ] Check APK size (target: <50MB optimized)
- [ ] Verify ProGuard obfuscation applied successfully

### 2️⃣ **Generate Production Keystore** 🔐

```powershell
# Run keystore generation script
.\generate_keystore.ps1

# Manual keystore creation
cd android
keytool -genkey -v -keystore gavra-release-key-new.keystore \
  -alias gavra-release-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 -storepass [SECURE_PASSWORD] \
  -keypass [SECURE_PASSWORD]
```

### 3️⃣ **Configure App Signing** 📝

Update `android/gradle.properties`:

```properties
KEYSTORE_FILE=gavra-release-key-new.keystore
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
KEY_ALIAS=gavra-release-key
KEY_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

Update `android/app/build.gradle.kts` signing config:

```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}
```

### 4️⃣ **Build Signed Production Files** 📦

```powershell
# Build signed APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle for Google Play Store
flutter build appbundle --release

# Run complete build script
.\build_production.ps1
```

# URGENT: Apple Developer Portal Configuration Checklist

## Build Status: 108+ CONSECUTIVE FAILURES
**Error**: "No profiles for 'com.gavra013.gavraAndroid' were found" + "0 valid identities found"

This is NOT a build configuration issue - this is an Apple Developer Portal setup problem.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Verify App ID Registration
**URL**: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId

✅ **CHECK**: Is Bundle ID `com.gavra013.gavraAndroid` registered?
- [ ] App ID exists in Apple Developer Portal
- [ ] Bundle ID exactly matches: `com.gavra013.gavraAndroid`
- [ ] App ID has correct capabilities enabled (Push Notifications, etc.)

### 2. Verify Certificate Status  
**URL**: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list

✅ **CHECK**: Is "Gavra Bus Distribution" certificate active?
- [ ] Certificate shows as "Active" (not expired/revoked)
- [ ] Certificate type is "iOS Distribution" 
- [ ] Certificate is linked to Team ID: `6CY9Q44KMQ`

### 3. Verify Provisioning Profile
**URL**: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list

✅ **CHECK**: Is "Gavra 013 App Store Profile" properly configured?
- [ ] Profile status is "Active"
- [ ] Profile type is "App Store"
- [ ] Profile is linked to App ID: `com.gavra013.gavraAndroid`
- [ ] Profile is linked to Certificate: "Gavra Bus Distribution"
- [ ] Profile is linked to Team: `6CY9Q44KMQ`

### 4. Download Fresh Files
If any of the above are missing/incorrect:

1. **Re-download Certificate**:
   - Go to Certificates → "Gavra Bus Distribution" → Download
   - Replace `ios_distribution.cer` in project

2. **Re-download Provisioning Profile**:
   - Go to Profiles → "Gavra 013 App Store Profile" → Download  
   - Replace `Gavra_013_App_Store_Profile_NEW.mobileprovision`

3. **Regenerate if necessary**:
   - If profile is invalid, delete and create new one
   - If certificate is expired, create new one

### 5. Team Settings Verification
**URL**: https://developer.apple.com/account/#!/membership/

✅ **CHECK**: Team membership and roles
- [ ] Team ID is exactly: `6CY9Q44KMQ`
- [ ] Your account has "Admin" or "App Manager" role
- [ ] Team has active Apple Developer Program membership

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

After 108+ builds, the error pattern indicates:

1. **Certificate not properly linked to Team** - Apple can't find any valid signing identities
2. **Provisioning Profile not linked to App ID** - No profiles found for bundle ID
3. **Possible App ID registration issue** - Bundle ID may not exist or be misconfigured

## NEXT STEPS

1. **FIRST**: Manually verify all 5 items above in Apple Developer Portal
2. **IF ISSUES FOUND**: Fix in portal, download fresh files, commit to trigger Build #109
3. **IF ALL CORRECT**: Check if someone else modified/deleted the configurations

## Why Previous Fixes Failed

- ✅ Codemagic YAML configuration is correct
- ✅ App Store Connect API key is working  
- ✅ Certificate and profile files exist in project
- ❌ **The problem is in Apple Developer Portal setup itself**

**Build #109 will only succeed after Apple Developer Portal issues are resolved.**
